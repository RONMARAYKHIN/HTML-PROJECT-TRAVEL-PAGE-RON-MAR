            Its city centre lies near the head of the Pearl River (Zhu Jiang) Delta, 
            more than 90 miles (145 km) inland from the South China Sea.

              It has served as a doorway for foreign influence since the 3rd century CE and was the first Chinese port to be regularly visited by European traders, 
              who called it Canton. The city is a historic centre of learning.</h2>
