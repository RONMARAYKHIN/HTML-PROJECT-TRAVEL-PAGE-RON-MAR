        <h2>Zürich, largest city of Switzerland and capital of the canton of Zürich. 
            Located in an Alpine setting at the northwestern end of Lake Zürich, this financial, cultural, and industrial centre stretches out between two forested chains of hills,
             about 40 miles (60 km) from the northern foothills of the Alps. 
             Two rivers, the Limmat and Sihl, run through the city. </h2>
